#  Simple Password

The goal of this program is to check to make sure that a password is the correct length.  Valid passwords must be between 8 to 20 characters in a string.  No more, no less.

You should make two functions. You should notice that this program is very similar to what we did in our class notes.  This is intentional.

## checkString()
-  This program takes one input named str, which is a common abbreviation for string.
-  Use a conditional statement that either returns the string as is, or throws a RangeError.

## getString()
-  Write a typical try/catch statement.
-  This function accepts one input str, which represents a string.
-  Try to check that str is a valid string.
-  Catch the error and re-try getString() recursively.
-  As an input for the recursive call, write a literal string that works.
